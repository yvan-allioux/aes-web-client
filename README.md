This is a simple, browser-based AES encryption and decryption tool. It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt messages using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and a secret key. This tool is designed to provide confidentiality for sensitive data exchanged between parties.

## Features

Encrypt and decrypt messages using AES
Generate secure AES-256 keys
Easy-to-use, browser-based interface
No server-side processing, ensuring data privacy

## Usage

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your favorite modern web browser.
Enter your message in the "Message" textarea.
Enter your secret key in the "Key" input field. Alternatively, click on the "New Key generation" button to generate a secure AES-256 key.
Click on the "Encrypt" button to encrypt your message. The encrypted message will be displayed in the output area.
To decrypt an encrypted message, enter the encrypted message in the "Message" textarea, provide the same secret key, and click on the "Decrypt" button. The decrypted message will be displayed in the output area.

## Security Considerations

This tool uses the AES algorithm, which is widely recognized for its robustness and security. However, the security provided by this tool also depends on how it is used. It is crucial to select a sufficiently long and complex secret key to prevent brute-force attacks. Additionally, make sure to share the secret key only with authorized parties to ensure the confidentiality of communications.
